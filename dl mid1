1. Explain the fundamental differences between a biological neuron and an artificial neuron, such as a Perceptron?
2. Describe the role of activation functions in a neural network. Why are non-linear activation functions essential for deep learning models?
3. Discuss the practical applications of Probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis.
4. What is the purpose of a loss function in training a neural network? Provide an example of a common loss function and the type of problem it is used for.
5. Discuss the concept of back-propagation and its importance in training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).
6. Compare and contrast Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in terms of their architecture and typical use cases?
7. What are hyper-parameters in the context of deep learning? Provide at least three examples and explain how they influence the training        process.
8. Explain the basic architecture of an autoencoder. What are the roles of the encoder and decoder?
9. Describe the building blocks of a deep learning model. How do these components work together to enable learning from data?
